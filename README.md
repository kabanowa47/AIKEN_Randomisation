# AIKEN_Randomisation
Simply create as many versions of the same quiz as you need by shuffling the quiz questions and possible answers! May be there are much better options for lazy teachers, but this one seems to be good enough.

Important: this early verssion app works only wiht AIKEN formated quiz that contains 'A' to 'E' possible answers. All the questions should be separated by an empty row. Upload only plain text file (your_file.txt). You may test this app using sample_quiz.txt file downloaded from this reposotory.
